# 🌦️ Weather App

## 📌 Project Overview
The Weather App is a responsive web application that provides real-time weather updates using public weather APIs. This project integrates **AI tools across all phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** to enhance automation, efficiency, and code quality.

> ✅ This project is developed as part of an academic assignment to demonstrate how AI can be used in modern DevOps and CI/CD pipelines.
