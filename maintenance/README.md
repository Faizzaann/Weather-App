# ðŸ›  Maintenance

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To ensure the Weather App remains functional, bug-free, and up-to-date post-deployment.

## ðŸ§  AI Tools Used
- **DeepSeek**: Assisted in reviewing legacy or inefficient PHP code for optimization.
- **ChatGPT**: Helped generate patch code for bugs identified during post-deployment.
  
## ðŸ”„ Maintenance Activities
- Regular API key validation and renewal.
- Fixing broken API endpoints or changes from weather API provider.
- Updating UI/UX based on user feedback.
- Refactoring inefficient code using DeepSeek suggestions.
- Database optimization using queries recommended by AI.

## ðŸ—“ Planned Maintenance Schedule
| Frequency    | Task                                   |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| Weekly       | Check PHP error logs and optimize DB   |
| Bi-weekly    | Update UI or content if needed         |
| Monthly      | Review API performance and key limits  |
| As-needed    | Hotfixes based on issues or feedback   |

## âœ… Long-Term Plans
- Automate version checks and notify developers of outdated libraries.
- Use CI/CD monitoring tools to validate every new build before release.
- Continuously refine backend PHP APIs for security and performance.

## ðŸ“· Maintenance Deliverables
- Logs showing maintenance changes
- Screenshots of improved performance metrics (if any)
- AI-generated code diffs from patches
