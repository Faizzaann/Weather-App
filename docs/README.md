## 📌 Planning & Requirements

### i. Requirements Analysis & AI Assistance

We used **ChatGPT** to:
- Analyze initial problem scope and understand functional requirements.
- Generate detailed user stories using the format: "As a [user], I want to [goal], so that [benefit]."
- Suggest modules for the application (e.g., weather search, forecast display, geolocation).
- Help prioritize features and prepare a lightweight project roadmap.

### ii. Project Estimation & Tracking (Jira + AI)

We used **Atlassian Jira** to:
- Create tasks, stories, and features.
- Assign effort using **Story Points** via Planning Poker estimation.
- Set timelines (start date and due date) and priorities.
- Visualize progress using Jira Kanban board.

We used **ChatGPT** to:
